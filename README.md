# Guided waves

This is the solution to the homework problems described in <https://github.com/yuanyajie/Physics422-waveguide>. The solution can be found in the jupyter notebook `waveguide-solution.ipynb`.

## How to Run the Jupyter Notebook

### Running on your own machine

You can download the jupyter notebook to your own computer and run it. In order to run the jupyter notebook, you need to have python3 installed. Additionally, numpy, matplotlib,Jupyterlab are needed. You can install these by running the following commands in your terminal:

    pip install numpy
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install jupyterlab

We use [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to make movies. This is not a part of python and you need to install it separately.

After installing all the above dependendies, you can start jupyter lab interface from your terminal by the following command

    jupyter lab

This will open up a browser window with the jupyter lab interface.

Alternatively, you can open and run the jupyter notebook in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
